## Overview
A wrapper for `loess{stats}` function that sets the `span` parameter by
repeated training/test splits (not the same as k-fold cross-validation
but similar).

## R code
The accompanying hp_loess.R is standalone code that can be called
by other functions, and testhp_loess.R is a problem that tests the former.
